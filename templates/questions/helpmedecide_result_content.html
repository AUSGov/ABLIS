    <h2>What is a company?</h2>
    <p>A company structure means your business is a <strong>separate legal entity</strong> from you. This means that it can borrow money and be sued like a person.</p>
    <p>A company has at least one owner (shareholder) and one director. You can be both.</p>
    <p>Companies are expensive and complicated to set up, and generally suit people who:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>expect their business income to be highly variable, and want the option to use losses to offset future profits</li>
        <li>think their business has a high risk of going into debt, and want to limit the risk of losing personal assets such as their home (limit their liability).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="registration-tip">
        <p>   It’s important to know that companies must meet complex reporting and legal requirements.</p>

    <h2>What is a trust?</h2>
    <p>In a trust structure, a trustee holds your business for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries).</p>
    <p>A trustee can be a person or a company, and is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses.</p>
