<h3>Who makes business decisions?</h3>
<div>
	<p>In a partnership structure, all partners share the business decisions equally. If a ‘formal partnership agreement’ or legal agreement is drawn up, decisions must follow what was agreed to in the partnership agreement.</p>
	<p>In a company, the directors are responsible for business decisions and must make a record of certain decisions. If you’re the only director, you have full control.</p>
	<p>If there is more than one director, the way the company will be run (including how decisions are made) will follow certain rules. These rules are usually set out in the company's <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/starting-a-company/constitution-and-replaceable-rules/" class="external-link" target="_blank">constitution or replaceable rules</a>.</p>

<div>

	<p>The cost of setting up a company is much higher compared to a sole trader. Company set up costs:

			<li><a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/starting-a-company/how-to-start-a-company/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Company registration</a> - $463 for a proprietary limited company.  With an annual review fee of $247.</li>

<h3>How easy is it to set up?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Setting up a partnership structure is relatively easy. On top of the typical business and tax registrations, and licences and permits, you will also need to set up a separate bank account.</p>
	<p>Setting up a company is more complicated, and you must understand your legal and tax obligations before registering. On top of the typical business and tax registrations, licences and permits you'll also need to set up a separate bank account and ensure the company has a <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/changes-to-your-company/company-addresses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">registered office and principal place of business</a>.</p>

<h3>Can I switch business structures easily?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Partnerships can generally switch to a different business structure quite easily, as long as all partners agree.</p>
	<p>A company can’t easily change business structures. To change, you need to:
		<ol>
			<li>deregister the company so that it is no longer a legal entity. To do this, you either <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/closing-your-company/deregistration/voluntarily-deregistering-a-company/" class="external-link" target="_blank">voluntarily deregister the company</a> (if it has net assets worth less than $1000) or <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/closing-your-company/deregistration/winding-up-a-solvent-company/" class="external-link" target="_blank">wind up the company</a> (if it has net assets worth more than $1000). Winding up a company can be quite complicated</li>
			<li>register your business in the new structure.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</div>
<h3>Who owns the money earned?</h3>
<div>
	<p>In a partnership, the money earned is usually shared among the partners equally. Partners also equally own losses. If a ‘formal partnership agreement’ or legal agreement is drawn up, earnings and losses must be shared according to what was agreed to. Find out more about <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/changing-business-structures/sole-trader-to-a-company/difference-sole-trader-and-company/Pages/how-is-business-income-accessed.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank">how business income is accessed</a>.</p>
	<p>In a company structure, the money belongs to the company. There are rules about how money is transferred to directors and shareholders. The money must be kept in a separate bank account and can’t be used for personal expenses. All money flowing in and out of a company must be documented and properly accounted for. See what rules apply when <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/changing-business-structures/sole-trader-to-a-company/difference-sole-trader-and-company/Pages/how-is-business-income-accessed.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank">you access business income</a> as a company.</p>
</div>
<h3>Who is responsible for losses?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Partners keep their share of income earned through the business, but are also personally responsible for all payments, taxes, liabilities and losses. The personal assets of partners can also be used to help pay for any business debts. Partners who have an unequal share of the partnership can have a ‘formal partnership agreement’ written up to detail the percentage of income paid to each partner as well as the percentage of losses each partner must pay.</p>
	<p>In a company structure, the company pays for all payments, taxes, liabilities and losses. As a director and shareholder your personal assets are separate from the company so can’t be used to pay company debts. In certain cases where directors breach their duties, they may be held personally responsible for company losses.

</div>
<h3>Risk to personal assets?</h3>
<div>
	<p>The liability of each partner is unlimited. This means all personal assets in your name can be used to pay business debts including if the business is sued. Your home and other assets could potentially be used to pay off the debt, even if the debt was incurred by another partner.</p>
	<p>A limited partnership structure can limit the risk to assets in certain cases, for example to protect silent partners who don’t make decisions or run the business. Find out more about <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/changing-business-structures/sole-trader-to-a-company/difference-sole-trader-and-company/Pages/who-is-liable-for-business-debts.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank">who is liable for business debts</a>.</p>
	<p>As a shareholder of a company there is no risk to your personal assets.  However, directors may be personally liable for company losses in certain circumstances or where they have breached their duties.</p>
</div>
<h3>Tax rate?</h3>
<div>
	<p>As a partner in a partnership, all the money you earn from the partnership is treated as personal income on your individual tax return. All of your income including money earned through your business will be taxed at your individual tax rate. If your total income is $18,200 or less, you don’t pay any tax. This is called the ‘tax-free threshold’. Anything above that amount will be taxed according to the amount of money you have earned. Although the partnership must also lodge a tax return, the partnership doesn’t pay tax separately.</p>
	<p>Work out your tax rate from our <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/changing-business-structures/sole-trader-to-a-company/difference-sole-trader-and-company/Pages/how-is-tax-calculated.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank">How is tax calculated?</a> page.</p>
	<p>Companies with a turnover of less than $2 million are taxed at 28.5%.  All other companies are taxed at 30%. There is no tax-free threshold for a company business structure.
