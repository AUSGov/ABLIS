<h3>Employees</h3>
<div>
	<p>Generally, employees:
		<ul>
			<li>are supervised by an employer</li>
			<li>are required to carry out their work in a particular way</li>
			<li>earn a wage or salary</li>
			<li>are entitled to paid leave</li>
			<li>work set hours on a permanent, fixed term or casual basis</li>
			<li>can't subcontract work tasks given to them.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Don't confuse employees with contractors! Contractors set up businesses to hire out their services to other businesses, and can negotiate their own working arrangements.</p>
	<p>If you're not sure whether you'll be taking on an employee or a contractor, try our <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Independent-contractors/Independent-contractors-decision-tool" class="external-link" target="_blank">Independent contractors decision tool</a>.

<h3 id="help-payg" style="display: none;">PAYG Withholding</h3>

	<p>When you have employees (this includes company directors), you must withhold tax amounts from the wage or salary payments you make to employees, and forward these tax amounts to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
	<p>PAYG Withholding isn't a tax on your business - it's a tax on your employees' income that you help the ATO to collect.</p>
