<h3>How many owners will your business have?</h3>
<div>
    <p>The number of owners may limit which business structure you can choose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A sole trader can only have a single owner.</li>
        <li>A company can have one or more owners.</li>
        <li>A partnership must have between two and twenty owners.</li>
        <li>A trust must have one trustee and one or more beneficiaries</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Will you hold and control an asset?</h3>
<div>
    <p>A trust is where an individual or business manages an asset (estate, property or business) on behalf of beneficiaries (people who receive profits from the asset). A trust is treated like an entity for tax purposes. The trust must register for certain tax registrations including a Tax File Number (TFN).</p>
    <p>Trusts are expensive and complex to set up and you’ll need time and the right skills to do it properly. It's best to see a qualiﬁed, licensed professional to help you understand what’s involved.</p>
