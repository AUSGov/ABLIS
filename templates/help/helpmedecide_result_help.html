    <h4>Multiple business names</h4>
    <p>
        You can give your business more than one name, if you have different parts of your business that you want to give different identities. For example, ‘George’s coffee shop’ and ‘George’s catering services’.
    </p>

    <h4>Protect your business name</h4>

    <p>
        If you want to stop anyone else using your business name, you should register it as a trade mark. Trade marking your business name means that it will be protected in all Australian states and territories for an initial period of 10 years.

    <h4>Websites and business names</h4>
    <p>
        Website addresses are called domain names, for example, sarahsflowers.com.au.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re keen to have domain name that reflects your business name, it’s a good idea to register a domain name, even if you’re not quite ready to set up your website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally prices range from $10 to $100 AUD for a year's registration.
