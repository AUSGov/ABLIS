<h3>Registering your business name</h3>
<div>
<p>Registering a business name means you're registering it nationally with the  Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC). This means you can use it in any state or territory. It costs $34 to register a business name for 1 year, and $79 for 3 years.</p>
<p>Before you register a business name, make sure it creates the right image for your business, and helps your business to stand out from your competitors.</p>

<h4>Protecting your business name</h4>
<div class="form-tip">
    <p>It's important to know that registering your business name does <strong>not</strong> give you exclusive rights to it! Other businesses won't be able to register your name, but they can still use it to name a product or service.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to stop others from using your business name, you should register it as a trade mark. Trade marking your business name means that it will be protected in all Australian states and territories for an initial period of 10 years. 
You can <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/applying-for-a-trade-mark/how-to-apply-for-a-trade-mark" class="external-link" target="_blank">apply for a trade mark</a> on the IP Australia website.</p>
<h4>Websites and business names</h4>
<p>Website addresses are called domain names, for example, sarahsflowers.com.au or josephsmitharchitects.com.au.</p>
<p>If you're keen to have domain name that reflects your business name, it's a good idea to register a domain name, even if you're not quite ready to set up your website. 
Generally prices range from $10 to $100 AUD for a year's registration. </p>

<h4>Having more than one business name</h4>
<p>You can give your business more than one name, if you have different parts of your business that you want to give different identities. For example, 'George's coffee shop' and 'George's catering services'.</p>

<h3>If you don’t need to register your business name</h3>

	<p>While you don't need to register your business name, it's a good idea to think about whether your business needs a website or social media accounts, and how you can connect your online presence to your business name.</p>
