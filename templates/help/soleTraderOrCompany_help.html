<h3>Who makes business decisions?</h3>
<div>
	<p>As a sole trader, you're responsible for all business decisions.</p>
	<p>In a company, the directors are responsible for business decisions and must make a record of certain decisions. If you’re the only director, you have full control.</p>
	<p>If there is more than one director, the way the company will be run (including how decisions are made) will follow certain rules. These rules are usually set out in the company's <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/starting-a-company/constitution-and-replaceable-rules/" class="external-link" target="_blank">constitution or replaceable rules</a>.</p>

<h3>What is the cost of setting up?</h3>
<div>
	<h4>Cost of setting up a sole trader</h4>
	<p>The cost of setting up a sole trader depends on the type of business you want to set up. Sole trader start-up costs can include:
		<ul>
			<li>Registering a <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/your-business/small-business/starting-a-small-business/small-business-registering-a-business-name/" class="external-link" target="_blank">business name</a> (if you need one) - $34 for one year or $79 for three years.</li>

<h3>How easy is it to set up?</h3>
<div>
	<h4>Setting up as a sole trader</h4>
	<p>Setting up a sole trader structure is relatively easy. Generally, you’re ready to go once you get your Australian Business Number (ABN) and register for any taxes, licences and permits. It’s recommended you set up a separate bank account, but it’s not necessary.</p>
	<h4>Setting up as a company</h4>
	<p>Setting up a company is more complicated, and you must understand your legal and tax obligations before registering. On top of the typical business and tax registrations, licences and permits you'll also need to set up a separate bank account and ensure the company has a <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/changes-to-your-company/company-addresses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">registered office and principal place of business</a>.</p>

</div>
<h3>Can I switch business structures easily?</h3>
<div>
	<p>A sole trader can easily switch to a partnership or company.</p>
	<p>A company can’t easily change business structures. To change, you need to:
		<ol>
			<li>deregister the company so that it is no longer a legal entity. To do this, you either <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/closing-your-company/deregistration/voluntarily-deregistering-a-company/" class="external-link" target="_blank">voluntarily deregister the company</a> (if it has net assets worth less than $1000) or <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/closing-your-company/deregistration/winding-up-a-solvent-company/" class="external-link" target="_blank">wind up the company</a> (if it has net assets worth more than $1000). Winding up a company can be quite complicated</li>
			<li>register your business in the new structure.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</div>
<h3>Who owns the money earned?</h3>
<div>
	<p>As a sole trader you own the money earned through the business. The money is treated as income on your personal tax return. You also own losses.</p>
	<p>In a company structure, the money belongs to the company. There are rules about how money is transferred to directors and shareholders. The money must be kept in a separate bank account and can’t be used for personal expenses. All money flowing in and out of a company must be documented and properly accounted for.</p>

</div>
<h3>Who is responsible for losses?</h3>
<div>
	<p>As a sole trader you are personally responsible for all payments, taxes, liabilities and losses. Your personal assets can be used to help pay for any business debts.</p>
	<p>In a company structure, the company is responsible for all payments, taxes, liabilities and losses. The personal assets of directors and shareholders are separate from the company, so they can’t be used to pay company debts. In certain cases where directors breach their duties, they may be held personally responsible for company losses. Find out <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/changing-business-structures/sole-trader-to-a-company/difference-sole-trader-and-company/Pages/who-is-liable-for-business-debts.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank">who is liable for business debts</a> and what that means for your business.</p>
</div>
<h3>Risk to personal assets?</h3>
<div>
	<p>As a sole trader, your liability is unlimited. This means all personal assets in your name can be used to pay business debts including if the business is sued. Find out more about <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/changing-business-structures/sole-trader-to-a-company/difference-sole-trader-and-company/Pages/who-is-liable-for-business-debts.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank">who is liable for business debts</a>.</p>
	<p>In a company structure, shareholders' personal assets aren't at risk. However, directors may be personally liable for company losses in certain circumstances or where they have breached their duties.</p>
</div>
<h3>Tax rate?</h3>
<div>
	<p>As a sole trader, all the money your business earns is treated as personal income on your tax return. All of your income, including money earned through your business, will be taxed at your individual tax rate. If your total income is $18,200 or less, you don’t pay any tax. This is called the ‘tax-free threshold’. Anything above that amount will be taxed according to the amount of money you have earned.</p>

	<p>Companies with a turnover of less than $2 million are taxed at 28.5%.  All other companies are taxed at 30%. There is no tax-free threshold for a company business structure.
