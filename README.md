Welcome the Australian Business Licence and Information Service (ABLIS) Proof of Concept Website

ABLIS APIs                    
You are currently viewing a prototype of the ABLIS website that has been developed to demonstrate the
use of APIs that are being developed to modernise the service.                      

This is NOT a production system, and any use of ABLIS in this environment should be for demonstration purposes only. 

ABLIS helps you search for and discover government licences, permits, approvals, registrations, codes of practice, 
standards and guidelines that you may need to know about to meet your compliance responsibilities with all 3 tiers 
of Australian Government: Commonwealth, State/Territory and local councils.             

ABLIS assists you by providing:A summary of Commonwealth, State/Territory and local council requirements 
relevant to your business type and locationInformation about licence fees, how to apply, periods of cover 
and renewalsHow to access application and renewal formsWhere to go for more help and information.                

This website is a proof of concept only and is being used to demonstrate the use of APIs being developed to 
support third parties consuming ABLIS services.
